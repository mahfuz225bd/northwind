# Nortwind
Microsoft's Northwind application is a powerful tool for learning and demonstration. With features like Product Management, Customer Management, Order Processing, Supplier Management, Employee Management, and Reporting & Analytics, it provides hands-on experience in database design and programming. I transformed it into a web app using React and Flask, available on my GitHub.
